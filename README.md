Kaggle Competitions Source Code
====

A repository containing the code of Kaggle Submissions of the contests I participated in. I've not added any CSV(train, test, etc.) files because of thier sizes. Instead I have added link to these CSVs in next section.


### Otto Group
The objective was to classify products into various categories for Otto Group. I tried using SVM with linear Kernel, a Random Forest and a GBM, till now SVM gave the best results.

<b>Type: Classification</b><br>

### Titanic
Predict the survival of people on Titanic, based on their individual attributes. A Random Forest Solution with some feature engineering worked pretty well.
