Kaggle Competitions Source Code
====

A repository containing the code of Kaggle Submissions of the contests I participated in. I've not added any CSV(train, test, etc.) files because of thier sizes. Instead I have added link to these CSVs in next section.


### Forest Cover
---
The objective here is the classify the samples into different forest cover. For now I have submitted 
a Random Forest solution with 2000 Trees and 15 max_features.

<b>Type: Classification</b><br>

### Otto Group
---
The objective was to classify products into various categories for Otto Group. I tried using SVM with linear Kernel, a Random Forest and a GBM, till now SVM gave the best results.

### TFI Restaurant Revenue
This is a prediction competition, where the target is the revenue of the different restaurants.
A Regression Random Forest Submission with a bit of feature engineering yielded the best result
for me, till now.

<b>Type: Prediction</b><br>

### Titanic
---
Predict the survival of people on Titanic, based on their individual attributes. A Random Forest Solution with some feature engineering worked pretty well.
